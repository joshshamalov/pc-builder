# PC Builder Web Application

The PC Builder website application will first prompt users to sign up/log in..
Then the user will be able to answer a questionnaire regarding the use-case of the PC.
The system will then generate a list of PC parts that will be added to the users account.
Lastly, the user will be able to purchase the computer parts from trusted third-party websites.
